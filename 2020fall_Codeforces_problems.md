## 4A. Watermelon

brute force/math, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A

****

One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed *w* kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

**Input**

The first (and the only) input line contains integer number *w* (1 ≤ *w* ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

**Output**

Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples

input

```
8
```

output

```
YES
```

Note

For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos)

## 1A. Theatre Square

math, 1000, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1/A

Theatre Square in the capital city of Berland has a rectangular shape with the size *n* × *m* meters. On the occasion of the city's anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size *a* × *a*.

What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square, but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides of the Square.

**Input**

The input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: *n*,  *m* and *a* (1 ≤  *n*, *m*, *a* ≤ 109).

**Output**

Write the needed number of flagstones.

Examples

input

```
6 6 4
```

output

```
4
```

## 58A. Chat room

greedy/strings, 1000, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/58/A

Vasya has recently learned to type and log on to the Internet. He immediately entered a chat room and decided to say hello to everybody. Vasya typed the word *s*. It is considered that Vasya managed to say hello if several letters can be deleted from the typed word so that it resulted in the word "hello". For example, if Vasya types the word "ahhellllloou", it will be considered that he said hello, and if he types "hlelo", it will be considered that Vasya got misunderstood and he didn't manage to say hello. Determine whether Vasya managed to say hello by the given word *s*.

**Input**

The first and only line contains the word *s*, which Vasya typed. This word consisits of small Latin letters, its length is no less that 1 and no more than 100 letters.

**Output**

If Vasya managed to say hello, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".

Examples

input

```
ahhellllloou
```

output

```
YES
```

input

```
hlelo
```

output

```
NO
```

## 71A. Way Too Long Words

strings, 1000, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A

Sometimes some words like "*localization*" or "*internationalization*" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word *too long*, if its length is **strictly more** than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, "*localization*" will be spelt as "*l10n*", and "*internationalization*" will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.

**Input**

The first line contains an integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100). Each of the following *n* lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.

**Output**

Print *n* lines. The *i*-th line should contain the result of replacing of the *i*-th word from the input data.

Examples

input

```
4
word
localization
internationalization
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
```

output

```
word
l10n
i18n
p43s
```



长度大于10 的单词缩写为首字母+中间字母数+尾字母

```Python

	length = len(word)
	if length >10:
		num = str(length-2)
		short = word[0]+num+word[-1]
		print(short)
	else:
		print(word)
```

==选择性输出，可以 在 print里 完成==

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
	a = input()
	l = len(a)
	print(a if l<11 else a[0]+str(l-2)+a[l-1])
```



## 231A. Team

bruteforce/greedy, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/231/A

One day three best friends Petya, Vasya and Tonya decided to form a team and take part in programming contests. Participants are usually offered several problems during programming contests. Long before the start the friends decided that they will implement a problem if at least two of them are sure about the solution. Otherwise, the friends won't write the problem's solution.

This contest offers *n* problems to the participants. For each problem we know, which friend is sure about the solution. Help the friends find the number of problems for which they will write a solution.

**Input**

The first input line contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 1000) — the number of problems in the contest. Then *n* lines contain three integers each, each integer is either 0 or 1. If the first number in the line equals 1, then Petya is sure about the problem's solution, otherwise he isn't sure. The second number shows Vasya's view on the solution, the third number shows Tonya's view. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the number of problems the friends will implement on the contest.

Examples

input

```
3
1 1 0
1 1 1
1 0 0
```

output

```
2
```

input

```
2
1 0 0
0 1 1
```

output

```
1
```

Note

In the first sample Petya and Vasya are sure that they know how to solve the first problem and all three of them know how to solve the second problem. That means that they will write solutions for these problems. Only Petya is sure about the solution for the third problem, but that isn't enough, so the friends won't take it.

In the second sample the friends will only implement the second problem, as Vasya and Tonya are sure about the solution.



三人小队，至少两个人会才能答出问题

```python
n = int(input())
num = 0
for i in range(n):
	a, b, c = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
	if a + b + c >1:
		num += 1
print(num)
```

short code

```python
print(sum(input().count('1')>1 for x in range(int(input()))))
```

==print()也 很 耗 时间，如果 要多次输出，可以在 print()里套循环，减少调用次数==



## 158A. Next Round

*special problem/implementation, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/158/A

"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the *k*-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." — an excerpt from contest rules.

A total of *n* participants took part in the contest (*n* ≥ *k*), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains two integers *n* and *k* (1 ≤ *k* ≤ *n* ≤ 50) separated by a single space.

The second line contains *n* space-separated integers *a*~1~, *a*~2~, ..., a~n~ (0 ≤ a~i~ ≤ 100), where a~i~ is the score earned by the participant who got the *i*-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all *i* from 1 to *n* - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: a~i~ ≥ a~i~ + 1).

**Output**

Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.

Examples

input

```
8 5
10 9 8 7 7 7 5 5
```

output

```
6
```

input

```
4 2
0 0 0 0
```

output

```
0
```

Note

In the first example the participant on the 5th place earned 7 points. As the participant on the 6th place also earned 7 points, there are 6 advancers.

In the second example nobody got a positive score.



统计不小于第k位选手得分的人数

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
score = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
num = 0
k_score = score[k-1]
for i in range(n):
	s = score[i]
	if s >= k_score and s>0:
		num += 1
print(num)
```

short code

```python
i=lambda:map(int,input().split())
n,k=i()
a=list(i())
print(sum([x>=(a[k-1] or 1) for x in a]))
```

## 118A. String Task

implementation/strings, 1000, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/A

Petya started to attend programming lessons. On the first lesson his task was to write a simple program. The program was supposed to do the following: in the given string, consisting if uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, it:

- deletes all the vowels,
- inserts a character "." before each consonant,
- replaces all uppercase consonants with corresponding lowercase ones.

Vowels are letters "A", "O", "Y", "E", "U", "I", and the rest are consonants. The program's input is exactly one string, it should return the output as a single string, resulting after the program's processing the initial string.

Help Petya cope with this easy task.

**Input**

The first line represents input string of Petya's program. This string only consists of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and its length is from 1 to 100, inclusive.

**Output**

Print the resulting string. It is guaranteed that this string is not empty.

Examples

input

```
tour
```

output

```
.t.r
```

input

```

```

output

```
.c.d.f.r.c.s
```

input

```

去掉元音，并用.来连接剩余字母的小写

```python
str = input()
word = str.lower()
output = []
vowel = ['a','e','i','o','u','y']
for char in word:
	if char not in vowel:
		output.append('.')
		output.append(char)
print(''.join(output))
```

print(''.join('.'+l for l in input().lower() if l not in 'aeiouy'))
```



## 50A. Domino piling

greedy/math, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/50/A

You are given a rectangular board of *M* × *N* squares. Also you are given an unlimited number of standard domino pieces of 2 × 1 squares. You are allowed to rotate the pieces. You are asked to place as many dominoes as possible on the board so as to meet the following conditions:

1. Each domino completely covers two squares.

2. No two dominoes overlap.

3. Each domino lies entirely inside the board. It is allowed to touch the edges of the board.

Find the maximum number of dominoes, which can be placed under these restrictions.

**Input**

In a single line you are given two integers *M* and *N* — board sizes in squares (1 ≤ *M* ≤ *N* ≤ 16).

**Output**

Output one number — the maximal number of dominoes, which can be placed.

Examples

input

```
2 4
```

output

```

## 282A. Bit++

implementation, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/282/A

The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.

The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called *x*. Also, there are two operations:

- Operation ++ increases the value of variable *x* by 1.
- Operation -- decreases the value of variable *x* by 1.

A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable *x*. The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters "+", "-", "X". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.

A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.

You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of *x* is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).

**Input**

The first line contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.

Next *n* lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and exactly one variable *x* (denoted as letter «X»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the final value of *x*.

Examples

input

```
1
++X
```

output

```
1
```

input

```
2
X++
--X
```

output

```
0
```

	statement = input()
	if '++' in statement:
		x += 1
	else:
		x -= 1
print(x)
```

f=input
print(sum('+'in f() or -1 for i in range(int(f()))))

## 112A. Petya and Strings

implementation/strings, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/112/A

Little Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.

**Input**

Each of the first two lines contains a bought string. The strings' lengths range from 1 to 100 inclusive. It is guaranteed that the strings are of the same length and also consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.

**Output**

If the first string is less than the second one, print "-1". If the second string is less than the first one, print "1". If the strings are equal, print "0". Note that the letters' case is not taken into consideration when the strings are compared.

Examples

input

```
aaaa
aaaA
```

output

```
0
```

input

```
abs
Abz
```

output

```
-1
```

input

```
abcdefg

```

output

```

## 263A. Beautiful Matrix

implementation, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/263/A

You've got a 5 × 5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one. Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's index the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the matrix:

1. Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes *i* and *i* + 1 for some integer *i* (1 ≤ *i* < 5).
2. Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes *j* and *j* + 1 for some integer *j* (1 ≤ *j* < 5).

You think that a matrix looks *beautiful*, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

**Input**

The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers: the *j*-th integer in the *i*-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the *i*-th row and the *j*-th column. It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

## 339A. Helpful Maths

greedy/implementation/sortings/strings, 800, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/339/A

Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.

The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.

You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.

**Input**

The first line contains a non-empty string *s* — the sum Xenia needs to count. String *s* contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "+". Besides, string *s* is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String *s* is at most 100 characters long.

**Output**

Print the new sum that Xenia can count.

Examples

input

```
3+2+1
```

There are *n* stones on the table in a row, each of them can be red, green or blue. Count the minimum number of stones to take from the table so that any two neighboring stones had different colors. Stones in a row are considered neighboring if there are no other stones between them.

**Input**

The first line contains integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 50) — the number of stones on the table.

The next line contains string *s*, which represents the colors of the stones. We'll consider the stones in the row numbered from 1 to *n* from left to right. Then the *i*-th character *s* equals "R", if the *i*-th stone is red, "G", if it's green and "B", if it's blue.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples

input

```
3
RRG
```

output

```

## 96A. Football

implementation/strings, 900, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/96/A

Petya loves football very much. One day, as he was watching a football match, he was writing the players' current positions on a piece of paper. To simplify the situation he depicted it as a string consisting of zeroes and ones. A zero corresponds to players of one team; a one corresponds to players of another team. If there are at least 7 players of some team standing one after another, then the situation is considered dangerous. For example, the situation 00100110111111101 is dangerous and 11110111011101 is not. You are given the current situation. Determine whether it is dangerous or not.

**Input**

**The first input lin**e contains a non-empty string consisting of characters "0" and "1", which represents players. The length of the string does not exceed 100 characters. There's at least one player from each team present on the field.

**Output**

Print "YES" if the situation is dangerous. Otherwise, print "NO".

Examples

input

```
001001
```

output

```
NO
```

input

```
1000000001
```

output

```
YES
```



```python
l = input()

n_0 = 0
n_1 = 0
for c in l:
        if c=='0':
                n_0 += 1
                if n_0==7: break
                n_1 = 0
        else:
                n_1 += 1
                if n_1==7: break
                n_0 = 0
                
if n_0==7 or n_1==7:
        print('YES')
else:
        print('NO')
```

```



## 615A. Bulbs

implementation, 800, http://codeforces.com/contest/615/problem/A 

Vasya wants to turn on Christmas lights consisting of *m* bulbs. Initially, all bulbs are turned off. There are *n* buttons, each of them is connected to some set of bulbs. Vasya can press any of these buttons. When the button is pressed, it turns on all the bulbs it's connected to. Can Vasya light up all the bulbs?

If Vasya presses the button such that some bulbs connected to it are already turned on, they do not change their state, i.e. remain turned on.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains integers *n* and *m* (1 ≤ *n*, *m* ≤ 100) — the number of buttons and the number of bulbs respectively.

Each of the next *n* lines contains *x~i~* (0 ≤ *x~i~*≤ *m*) — the number of bulbs that are turned on by the *i*-th button, and then *x~i~* numbers *y~ij~* (1 ≤ *y~ij~* ≤ *m*) — the numbers of these bulbs.

**Output**

If it's possible to turn on all *m* bulbs print "YES", otherwise print "NO".

Examples

input

```
3 4
2 1 4
3 1 3 1
1 2
```

output

```
YES
```

input

```
3 3
1 1
1 2
1 1
```

output

```
NO
```

Note

In the first sample you can press each button once and turn on all the bulbs. In the 2 sample it is impossible to turn on the 3-rd lamp.



```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
s = set()
for _ in range(n):
    s.update(input().split()[1:])

print(['NO','YES'][len(s)==m])
```

## 236A. Boy or Girl

brute force/implementation/strings, 800, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/236/A

Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.

**Input**

The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

**Output**

If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

Examples

input

```
wjmzbmr
```

output

```
CHAT WITH HER!
```

input

```
xiaodao
```

output

```
IGNORE HIM!
```

input

```
sevenkplus
```

output

```
CHAT WITH HER!
```

Note

For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print "CHAT WITH HER!".



```python
s = input()
fq = 26*[0]

for c in s:
        fq[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1

nCount = 0
for i in range(26):
        if fq[i]!=0 :
                nCount += 1

if nCount%2 == 1:
        print('IGNORE HIM!')
else:
        print('CHAT WITH HER!')
```



```python
s = set()
s.update(input())
if len(s)%2 == 1:
    print('IGNORE HIM!')
else:
    print('CHAT WITH HER!')
```

update Method:

This method is used to return the union of a set and the set of elements from one or more iterable like string, list, set. It is very similar to **union()** method, with difference is that where union() method create and return a new set, containing all the elements ( distinct ) present in all the iterables, update() method updates the set on which this method is called with all the distinct elements present in all the iterables.



## 69A. Young Physicist

implementation/math, 1000, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/69/A

A guy named Vasya attends the final grade of a high school. One day Vasya decided to watch a match of his favorite hockey team. And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. "Piece of cake" — thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. So, Vasya began to solve the problem. But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, and Vasya can not cope without your help. Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or is moving by the given vectors of forces.

**Input**

The first line contains a positive integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100), then follow *n* lines containing three integers each: the *x~i~* coordinate, the *y~i~* coordinate and the *z~i~* coordinate of the force vector, applied to the body ( - 100 ≤ *x~i~*, *y~i~*, *z~i~* ≤ 100).

**Output**

Print the word "YES" if the body is in equilibrium, or the word "NO" if it is not.

Examples

input

```
3
4 1 7
-2 4 -1
1 -5 -3

        x += f[0]
        y += f[1]
        z += f[2]

if x==y==z==0:

## 25A. IQ test

brute force, 1300, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/25/A

Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given *n* numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given *n* numbers finds one that is different in evenness.

**Input**

The first line contains integer *n* (3 ≤ *n* ≤ 100) — amount of numbers in the task. The second line contains *n* space-separated natural numbers, not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed, that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in evenness.

**Output**

Output index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.

## 122A. Lucky Division

brute force, number theory, 1000, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/122/A

Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits **4** and **7**. For example, numbers **47**, **744**, **4** are lucky and **5**, **17**, **467** are not.

Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number *n* is almost lucky.

**Input**

The single line contains an integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 1000) — the number that needs to be checked.

**Output**

In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes), if number *n* is almost lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

Examples

input

```
47
```

output

```
YES
```

input

```
16
```

output

```
YES
```

input

```
78
```

output

```
NO
```

Note

Note that all lucky numbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible by itself.

In the first sample 47 is a lucky number. In the second sample 16 is divisible by 4.



```python
n = int(input())

for i in {4,7,47,74,447,474,477,747,774}:
    if n%i == 0:
        print('YES')
        break
else:
    print('NO')

## 723A. The New Year: Meeting Friends

implementation, math, sorting, 800, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/723/A

There are three friend living on the straight line *Ox* in Lineland. The first friend lives at the point $x_{1}$, the second friend lives at the point $x_{2}$, and the third friend lives at the point $x_{3}$. They plan to celebrate the New Year together, so they need to meet at one point. What is the minimum total distance they have to travel in order to meet at some point and celebrate the New Year?

It's guaranteed that the optimal answer is always integer.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains three **distinct** integers $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$ and $x_{3}$ (1 ≤ $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$,$x_{3}$  ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the houses of the first, the second and the third friends respectively.

**Output**

Print one integer — the minimum total distance the friends need to travel in order to meet together.

Examples

input

```
7 1 4
```

output

```
6
```

input

```
30 20 10
```

output

```
20
```

Note

In the first sample, friends should meet at the point 4. Thus, the first friend has to travel the distance of 3 (from the point 7 to the point 4), the second friend also has to travel the distance of 3 (from the point 1 to the point 4), while the third friend should not go anywhere because he lives at the point 4.

## 705A. Hulk

implementation, 800, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/705/A

Dr. Bruce Banner hates his enemies (like others don't). As we all know, he can barely talk when he turns into the incredible Hulk. That's why he asked you to help him to express his feelings.

Hulk likes the Inception so much, and like that his feelings are complicated. They have *n* layers. The first layer is hate, second one is love, third one is hate and so on...

For example if *n* = 1, then his feeling is "I hate it" or if *n* = 2 it's "I hate that I love it", and if *n* = 3 it's "I hate that I love that I hate it" and so on.

Please help Dr. Banner.

**Input**

The only line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100) — the number of layers of love and hate.

**Output**

Print Dr.Banner's feeling in one line.

Examples

input

```
1
```

output

```
I hate it
```

input

```
2
```

output

```
I hate that I love it
```

input

## 200B. Drinks

implementation, math, 800, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/200/B

Little Vasya loves orange juice very much. That's why any food and drink in his kitchen necessarily contains orange juice. There are *n* drinks in his fridge, the volume fraction of orange juice in the *i*-th drink equals *p~i~* percent.

One day Vasya decided to make himself an orange cocktail. He took equal proportions of each of the *n* drinks and mixed them. Then he wondered, how much orange juice the cocktail has.

Find the volume fraction of orange juice in the final drink.

**Input**

The first input line contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100) — the number of orange-containing drinks in Vasya's fridge. The second line contains *n* integers *p~i~* (0 ≤ *p~i~* ≤ 100) — the volume fraction of orange juice in the *i*-th drink, in percent. The numbers are separated by a space.

**Output**

Print the volume fraction in percent of orange juice in Vasya's cocktail. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-4^.

Examples

input

```
3
50 50 100
```

output

```
66.666666666667
```

input

```
4
0 25 50 75
```

output

```
37.500000000000
```

Note

Note to the first sample: let's assume that Vasya takes *x* milliliters of each drink from the fridge. Then the volume of pure juice in the cocktail will equal ![img](https://espresso.codeforces.com/c1fac6e64d3a8ee6a5ac138cbe51e60039b22473.png) milliliters. The total cocktail's volume equals 3·*x* milliliters, so the volume fraction of the juice in the cocktail equals ![img](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ceb0664e55a1f9f5fa1243ec74680a4665a4d58d.png), that is, 66.(6) percent.

## 492B. Vanya and Lanterns

binary search/implementation/math/sortings, 1200, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/492/B

Vanya walks late at night along a straight street of length $l$, lit by *n* lanterns. Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point $l$. Then the *i*-th lantern is at the point *a~i~*. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most $d$ from it, where $d$ is some positive number, common for all lanterns.

Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius $d$ should the lanterns have to light the whole street?

**Input**

The first line contains two integers $n$, $l$ (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ $l$ ≤ 10^9^) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively.

The next line contains *n* integers *a~i~* (0 ≤ *a~i~* ≤ $l$). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.

**Output**

Print the minimum light radius $d$, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^-9^.

Examples

input

```
7 15

## 508A. Pasha and Pixels

brute force, 1100, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/508/A

Pasha loves his phone and also putting his hair up... But the hair is now irrelevant.

Pasha has installed a new game to his phone. The goal of the game is following. There is a rectangular field consisting of *n* row with *m* pixels in each row. Initially, all the pixels are colored white. In one move, Pasha can choose any pixel and color it black. In particular, he can choose the pixel that is already black, then after the boy's move the pixel does not change, that is, it remains black. Pasha loses the game when a 2 × 2 square consisting of black pixels is formed.

Pasha has made a plan of *k* moves, according to which he will paint pixels. Each turn in his plan is represented as a pair of numbers *i* and *j*, denoting respectively the row and the column of the pixel to be colored on the current move.

Determine whether Pasha loses if he acts in accordance with his plan, and if he does, on what move the 2 × 2 square consisting of black pixels is formed.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains three integers *n*, *m*, *k* (1 ≤ *n*, *m* ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ *k* ≤ 10^5^) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of moves that Pasha is going to perform.

The next *k* lines contain Pasha's moves in the order he makes them. Each line contains two integers *i* and *j* (1 ≤ *i* ≤ *n*, 1 ≤ *j* ≤ *m*), representing the row number and column number of the pixel that was painted during a move.

**Output**

If Pasha loses, print the number of the move when the 2 × 2 square consisting of black pixels is formed.

If Pasha doesn't lose, that is, no 2 × 2 square consisting of black pixels is formed during the given *k* moves, print 0.

## 456A. Laptops

sortings, 1100, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/456/A

One day Dima and Alex had an argument about the price and quality of laptops. Dima thinks that the more expensive a laptop is, the better it is. Alex disagrees. Alex thinks that there are two laptops, such that the price of the first laptop is less (strictly smaller) than the price of the second laptop but the quality of the first laptop is higher (strictly greater) than the quality of the second laptop.

Please, check the guess of Alex. You are given descriptions of *n* laptops. Determine whether two described above laptops exist.

**Input**

The first line contains an integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 10^5^) — the number of laptops.

Next *n* lines contain two integers each, *a~i~* and *b~i~* (1 ≤ *a~i~*, *b~i~* ≤ *n*), where *a~i~* is the price of the *i*-th laptop, and *b~i~* is the number that represents the quality of the *i*-th laptop (the larger the number is, the higher is the quality).

All *a~i~* are distinct. All *b~i~* are distinct.

**Output**

If Alex is correct, print "Happy Alex", otherwise print "Poor Alex" (without the quotes). 

Examples

input

```
2
1 2
2 1
```

output

```
Happy Alex
```



```python
n = int(input())
s = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for _ in range(n)]
s.sort(reverse=True)
 
for i in s[1:]:
    if i[1] > s[0][1]:
        print('Happy Alex')
        break
    
    s[0][1] = i[1] 
else:
    print('Poor Alex')

## 1425A. Arena of Greed

games, greedy, 1400, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1425/A

Lately, Mr. Chanek frequently plays the game **Arena of Greed**. As the name implies, the game's goal is to find the greediest of them all, who will then be crowned king of Compfestnesia.

The game is played by two people taking turns, where Mr. Chanek takes the first turn. Initially, there is a treasure chest containing N gold coins. The game ends if there are no more gold coins in the chest. In each turn, the players can make one of the following moves:

- Take one gold coin from the chest.
- Take half of the gold coins on the chest. This move is only available if the number of coins in the chest is even.

Both players will try to maximize the number of coins they have. Mr. Chanek asks your help to find the maximum number of coins he can get at the end of the game if both he and the opponent plays optimally.

**Input**

The first line contains a single integer T (1≤T≤10^5^) denotes the number of test cases.

The next T lines each contain a single integer N (1≤N≤10^18^).

**Output**

T lines, each line is the answer requested by Mr. Chanek.

Example

input

```
2
5
6
```

output

```
2
4
```

**Note**

For the first case, the game is as follows:

1. Mr. Chanek takes one coin.
2. The opponent takes two coins.
3. Mr. Chanek takes one coin.
4. The opponent takes one coin.

For the second case, the game is as follows:

1. Mr. Chanek takes three coins.
2. The opponent takes one coin.
3. Mr. Chanek takes one coin.
4. The opponent takes one coin.

解题思路：简单试验可得，拿到偶数币时，除 4外，最优解法均为使对方拿到奇数币而只能取走一个；拿到奇数币时无法决策，被对方“控场”，对方获得币数-1的最优解。故据此进行迭代。

PyPy3 AC

```python
ans = []
def solve(n):
    
    f = s = 0 # To distinguish between first and second hands.
    fs = True
    
    if n & 1:	#如果起始硬币数量为奇数，那么先手方能拿到的最多硬币数转化为后手方的情形
        n -= 1
        fs = False
        
    while n:
        if n == 4:
            f += 3
            s += 1
            n = 0   # Special Judge
        elif (n//2) & 1: # The First Situation
            f += n//2
            s += 1
            n = (n//2) - 1;
        else:                   #The Second Situation
            f += 1
            s += 1
            n -= 2
    #print( [s+1, f][fs] )
    ans.append( [s+1, f][fs] )
 
 
coins = []
for _ in range(int(input())):
    coins.append(int(input()))
 
for i in coins:
    if i==1:

```



2020fall-cs101，李元锋。

思路：了解过博弈论的经典游戏的人应该可以很快写出代码。此游戏为完全信息博弈，故如果存在最优解，则所有玩家采取的策略是一样的，策略为让对方为奇数 > 让自己拿偶数，这里只有 4为特例，要注意，剩下的很简单就写出来了，麻烦在于超时，改了很多次才 AC，这里顺便学了一下异或运算来区别是谁的回合。

```python
output = []
for i in range(int(input())):
    n=int(input())
    ans, flag = 0, 1
    while n:
        test = 0
        if n%2==0 and n//2%2 or n==4:
            n //= 2
            test = n
        else:
            n -= 1
            test = 1
        if flag:
            ans += test
        flag ^= 1
    output.append(ans)

## 580C. Kefa and Park

dfs and similar/graphs/trees, 1500,  https://codeforces.com/contest/580/problem/C

Kefa decided to celebrate his first big salary by going to the restaurant.

He lives by an unusual park. The park is a rooted tree consisting of *n* vertices with the root at vertex 1. Vertex 1 also contains Kefa's house. Unfortunaely for our hero, the park also contains cats. Kefa has already found out what are the vertices with cats in them.

The leaf vertices of the park contain restaurants. Kefa wants to choose a restaurant where he will go, but unfortunately he is very afraid of cats, so there is no way he will go to the restaurant if the path from the restaurant to his house contains more than *m* **consecutive** vertices with cats.

Your task is to help Kefa count the number of restaurants where he can go.

Input

The first line contains two integers, *n* and *m* (2 ≤ *n* ≤ 10^5^, 1 ≤ *m* ≤ *n*) — the number of vertices of the tree and the maximum number of consecutive vertices with cats that is still ok for Kefa.

The second line contains *n* integers a~1~, a~2~, ..., a~n~, where each a~i~ either equals to 0 (then vertex *i* has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex *i* has a cat).

Next *n* - 1 lines contains the edges of the tree in the format "x~i~ y~i~" (without the quotes) (1 ≤ x~i~, y~i~ ≤ *n*, x~i~ ≠ y~i~), where x~i~ and y~i~ are the vertices of the tree, connected by an edge.

It is guaranteed that the given set of edges specifies a tree.

Output

A single integer — the number of distinct leaves of a tree the path to which from Kefa's home contains at most *m* consecutive vertices with cats.

Examples

input

```
4 1
1 1 0 0
1 2
1 3
1 4
```

output

```
2
```

input

```
7 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 0
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
```

output

```
2
```

Note

Let us remind you that a *tree* is a connected graph on *n* vertices and *n* - 1 edge. A *rooted* tree is a tree with a special vertex called *root*. In a rooted tree among any two vertices connected by an edge, one vertex is a parent (the one closer to the root), and the other one is a child. A vertex is called a *leaf*, if it has no children.

Note to the first sample test:

![img](https://espresso.codeforces.com/785114b4b3f5336f02078c25750f87c5a1d0b4be.png)

The vertices containing cats are marked red. The restaurants are at vertices 2, 3, 4. Kefa can't go only to the restaurant located at vertex 2.

Note to the second sample test:

![img](https://espresso.codeforces.com/e5c07640680c837aec99126d94287872e69aa09a.png)



The restaurants are located at vertices 4, 5, 6, 7. Kefa can't go to restaurants 6, 7.

## 368B. Sereja and Suffixes

data structures/dp, 1100,  https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/368/B

Sereja has an array *a*, consisting of *n* integers a~1~, a~2~, ..., a~n~. The boy cannot sit and do nothing, he decided to study an array. Sereja took a piece of paper and wrote out *m* integers $l_1, l_2, ..., l_m~$ (1 ≤ $l_i$ ≤ *n*). For each number $l_i$ he wants to know how many distinct numbers are staying on the positions $l_i, l_{i + 1}, ..., n$. Formally, he want to find the number of distinct numbers among $a_{l_i}, a_{l_{i + 1}}, ..., a_n$.?

Sereja wrote out the necessary array elements but the array was so large and the boy was so pressed for time. Help him, find the answer for the described question for each $l_i$.

**Input**

The first line contains two integers *n* and *m* (1 ≤ *n*, *m* ≤ 10^5^). The second line contains *n* integers a~1~, a~2~, ..., a~n~ (1 ≤ a~i~ ≤ 10^5^) — the array elements.

Next *m* lines contain integers $l_1, l_2, ..., l_m$. The *i*-th line contains integer $l_i$ (1 ≤ $l_i$ ≤ *n*).

**Output**

Print *m* lines — on the *i*-th line print the answer to the number $l_i$.

**Examples**

**要求数据结构实现一次，dp实现一次**

DP方法：

2020fall-cs101，郭冠廷。本题的思路不困难，只需反序 dp即可（甚至看不出 dp）。为了节省时间，应用到了两个窍门：1）将已经读取的数据投入到 set中，这样能避免列表查找的缓速。2）将答案储存在一个列表中，同时输出。、二者都是以空间换时间。

```python
n,m = map(int, input().split())
nl = [int(x) for x in input().split()]

out = 0
dp = []

tset = set()
for i in reversed(nl):
    if i not in tset:
        out += 1
        tset.add(i)
    dp.append(out)

for _ in range(m):
    pos = len(nl) - int(input())
    print(dp[pos])
```



2020fall-cs101，王康安。最开始用 in去判断，tle了。于是开一个到一万的桶，空间换时间，成功 AC。

```python
n,m = map(int,input().split())
seq = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
dp = [0]*(n-1)+[1]
barrel = [False]*(100000+1)
barrel[seq[n-1]] = True
for i in reversed(range(n-1)):
    if barrel[seq[i]]:        
        dp[i] = dp[i+1]
    else:        
        dp[i] = dp[i+1]+1        
        barrel[seq[i]] = True
for i in range(m):
    print(dp[int(input())-1])
```



data structures方法：

2020fall-cs101，蓝克轩。解题思路：先用dictionary记录每个元素数量，然后从第一个元素开始，每一个元素从dictionary减一，如果在dictionary对应对应的因素是0就去除，dictionary的长度即是不同元素的数量。

```python
n, m = map(int,input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
adic = {}
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] in adic:
        adic[a[i]] += 1
    else:
        adic[a[i]] = 1
 
ans = [0]*n
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] in adic:
        if adic[a[i]] == 1:
            adic.pop(a[i])
            ans[i] += 1
        else:
            adic[a[i]] -= 1

You've got string *s* = s~1~s~2~... s~n~ (*n* is the length of the string), consisting only of characters "." and "#" and *m* queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers $l_i, r_i (1 ≤ l_i < r_i ≤ n)$. The answer to the query $l_i, r_i$ is the number of such integers $i (l_i ≤ i < r_i)$, that $s_i = s_i + 1$.

Ilya the Lion wants to help his friends but is there anyone to help him? Help Ilya, solve the problem.

**Input**

The first line contains string *s* of length *n* (2 ≤ *n* ≤ 10^5^). It is guaranteed that the given string only consists of characters "." and "#".

The next line contains integer *m* (1 ≤ *m* ≤ 10^5^) — the number of queries. Each of the next *m* lines contains the description of the corresponding query. The *i*-th line contains integers $l_i, r_i (1 ≤ l_i < r_i ≤ n)$.

**Output**

Print *m* integers — the answers to the queries in the order in which they are given in the input.

answer = []
for i in range(1, len(s)):
    if s[i]==s[i-1]:

## 706B. Interesting drink

binary search/dp/implementation, 1100,  https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/706/B

Vasiliy likes to rest after a hard work, so you may often meet him in some bar nearby. As all programmers do, he loves the famous drink "Beecola", which can be bought in *n* different shops in the city. It's known that the price of one bottle in the shop *i* is equal to *x~i~* coins.

Vasiliy plans to buy his favorite drink for *q* consecutive days. He knows, that on the *i*-th day he will be able to spent *m~i~* coins. Now, for each of the days he want to know in how many different shops he can buy a bottle of "Beecola".

**Input**

The first line of the input contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100 000) — the number of shops in the city that sell Vasiliy's favourite drink.

The second line contains *n* integers *x~i~* (1 ≤ *x~i~* ≤ 100 000) — prices of the bottles of the drink in the *i*-th shop.

The third line contains a single integer *q* (1 ≤ *q* ≤ 100 000) — the number of days Vasiliy plans to buy the drink.

Then follow *q* lines each containing one integer *m~i~* (1 ≤ *m~i~* ≤ 10^9^) — the number of coins Vasiliy can spent on the *i*-th day.

**Output**

Print *q* integers. The *i*-th of them should be equal to the number of shops where Vasiliy will be able to buy a bottle of the drink on the *i*-th day.

Example

input

```
5
3 10 8 6 11

```

Note

On the first day, Vasiliy won't be able to buy a drink in any of the shops.

On the second day, Vasiliy can buy a drink in the shops 1, 2, 3 and 4.

On the third day, Vasiliy can buy a drink only in the shop number 1.

Finally, on the last day Vasiliy can buy a drink in any shop.

706B 思路：暴力超时，用二分查找或者动态规划二分查找：一般二分查找会返回数的位置或者找不到，但这个题只需要找到价格中小于等于输入和大于等于输入的分界线即可，所以查找上界 left 和 right，在 while 循环中取 left>=mid 时right=mid-1，最后结果就是上界 right+1。

```python
n = int(input())
shop = sorted(list(map(int,input().split())))
m = int(input())
for i in range(m):
    a = int(input())
    l = 0
    r = n-1
    while l<=r:
        mid = (l+r)//2
        if a < shop[mid]:
            r = mid-1
        elif a >= shop[mid]:
            l = mid + 1
    print(r+1)
```

解题思路：这道题试了一下用 bisect库做，觉得挺方便的

```Python
import bisect
input()
lt=sorted([int(i) for i in input().split()])
for i in range(int(input())):
    print(bisect.bisect(lt,int(input())))
```

思路：让区间[a,b]不断折半，且始终满足x[a] <= p < x[b] ；直到a = b – 1。  a就是我“刚好吃的起”的那个餐馆的位次，也即我吃得起的餐馆的总数量。binary search 也是第一次见。思考怎么实现时的第一反应：“这不就是高数里的闭区间套吗？”于是按自己的思路很快写出来了，并且一次submitAC. 很满意。

```python
def search(t):
    a = 0
    b = n
    while a != b-1:
        temp = (a+b)//2
        if x[temp] > t: 
            b = temp
        else:
            a = temp
        
    return a

n = int(input())
x = [int(x) for x in input().split()] 
q = int(input()) 
x.sort() 
x.insert(0, 0) 

for i in range(q):     
    p = int(input())     
    if p >= x[n]:         
        print(n)     
    else:        
        print(search(p)) 
```





## 1425A. Arena of Greed

games/greedy, 1400, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1425/A

Lately, Mr. Chanek frequently plays the game **Arena of Greed**. As the name implies, the game's goal is to find the greediest of them all, who will then be crowned king of Compfestnesia.

The game is played by two people taking turns, where Mr. Chanek takes the first turn. Initially, there is a treasure chest containing N gold coins. The game ends if there are no more gold coins in the chest. In each turn, the players can make one of the following moves:

- Take one gold coin from the chest.
- Take half of the gold coins on the chest. This move is only available if the number of coins in the chest is even.

Both players will try to maximize the number of coins they have. Mr. Chanek asks your help to find the maximum number of coins he can get at the end of the game if both he and the opponent plays optimally.

**Input**

The first line contains a single integer T (1≤T≤10^5^) denotes the number of test cases.

The next T lines each contain a single integer N (1≤N≤10^18^).

**Output**

T lines, each line is the answer requested by Mr. Chanek.

Example

input

```
2
5
6
```

output

```
2
4
```

Note

For the first case, the game is as follows:

1. Mr. Chanek takes one coin.
2. The opponent takes two coins.
3. Mr. Chanek takes one coin.
4. The opponent takes one coin.

For the second case, the game is as follows:

1. Mr. Chanek takes three coins.
2. The opponent takes one coin.
3. Mr. Chanek takes one coin.
4. The opponent takes one coin.



思路：为了获取最多的石子数量：

1. 数量为奇数时：只能取1个，然后对手进入情况2，我们只能取剩下的；
2. 数量为偶数时：为了尽可能最大化所能取的石子数量，我们尽可能使得对手只能取1个，即使得对手取时数量为奇数；同时使得我们取石子时数量为偶数。
为了实现这个情况，判断一下当前石子数量的一半是否为奇数，如果是，我们就取一半；如果不是，我们就取一个，对应的，对手也只能取一个，之后所得到的偶数的一般必然是个奇数。证明略。
3. 此外1和4是特殊情况，需要特判一下。

## 1443C. The Delivery Dilemma

binary search/greedy/sortings, 1400, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1443/C

Petya is preparing for his birthday. He decided that there would be nn different dishes on the dinner table, numbered from 1 to n. Since Petya doesn't like to cook, he wants to order these dishes in restaurants.

Unfortunately, all dishes are prepared in different restaurants and therefore Petya needs to pick up his orders from nn different places. To speed up this process, he wants to order courier delivery at some restaurants. Thus, for each dish, there are two options for Petya how he can get it:

- the dish will be delivered by a courier from the restaurant ii, in this case the courier will arrive in aiai minutes,
- Petya goes to the restaurant ii on his own and picks up the dish, he will spend bibi minutes on this.

Each restaurant has its own couriers and they start delivering the order at the moment Petya leaves the house. In other words, all couriers work in parallel. Petya must visit all restaurants in which he has not chosen delivery, he does this consistently.

For example, if Petya wants to order n=4 dishes and a=[3,7,4,5], and b=[2,1,2,4], then he can order delivery from the first and the fourth restaurant, and go to the second and third on your own. Then the courier of the first restaurant will bring the order in 3 minutes, the courier of the fourth restaurant will bring the order in 5 minutes, and Petya will pick up the remaining dishes in 1+2=3 minutes. Thus, in 5 minutes all the dishes will be at Petya's house.

Find the minimum time after which all the dishes can be at Petya's home.

**Input**

The first line contains one positive integer t (1≤t≤2⋅10^5^) — the number of test cases. Then tt test cases follow.

Each test case begins with a line containing one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅10^5^) — the number of dishes that Petya wants to order.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a~1~…a~n~ (1≤a~i~≤10^9^) — the time of courier delivery of the dish with the number ii.

The third line of each test case contains n integers b~1~…b~n~ (1≤bi≤10^9^) — the time during which Petya will pick up the dish with the number ii.

The sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5^.

**Output**

For each test case output one integer — the minimum time after which all dishes can be at Petya's home.

Example

2020fall-cs101-张聪，思路：由于 delivery是并行的，pick 是串行的，很自然地想到 delivery 应该优先。所以构建二维数组并对其根据 delivery 时间排序，然后用 greedy 算法思想，找到最小的并行时间，要求其能够覆盖delivery 时间更长的 dish 的串行时间之和。

2020fall-cs101-施惟明，思路：1）听闻此题 tle主要来源于读入数据的耗时，便考虑采用空间换时间的策略，先一波读入所有数据，再进行处理。2）处理部分仍然是 greedy，尽量自己取耗时长的外卖，当自己取的时长和外卖送到的最慢时长相等时为最佳。复杂度 O(nlogn)（上一次好像忘记考虑 sort的复杂度了...）。



2020fall-cs101-成泽凯，思路：首先将每个菜的配送用时a~i~和自取用时b~i~配对，然后按配送用时a~i~降序排。因为配送时每个餐馆同时送，所以实际上配送用时短的会被配送用时长的覆盖掉。从前向后遍历，并求自取用时的前缀和sum[j]，当自取用时的前缀和比配送用时a~j~大。

（由于Test9有 200000个输入，所以一个一个输出处理会超时，经施惟明，成泽恺等同学提醒后，修改了Python代码，使得只输出一次，成功 ac 了。）

2020fall-cs101-王君宇，当我写完高数作业看群，群里的大佬说 python常规方法可以 AC！！我们平时做这种多组 test问题都是直接循环每次 print，但是也可以将每次结果存到一个列表中，最后一起print，这样能大大加快速度。确实我对于 python中各个函数的运行速度还不够了解，这道题锻炼了我的程序思维，更让我加深了对 print函数的理解。当我看到自己的代码 AC的那一刻，这个下午的失败值得了！！！

## 189A. Cut Ribbon

brute force/dp, 1300, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/189/A

Polycarpus has a ribbon, its length is *n*. He wants to cut the ribbon in a way that fulfils the following two conditions:

- After the cutting each ribbon piece should have length *a*, *b* or *c*.
- After the cutting the number of ribbon pieces should be maximum.

Help Polycarpus and find the number of ribbon pieces after the required cutting.

**Input**

The first line contains four space-separated integers *n*, *a*, *b* and *c* (1 ≤ *n*, *a*, *b*, *c* ≤ 4000) — the length of the original ribbon and the acceptable lengths of the ribbon pieces after the cutting, correspondingly. The numbers *a*, *b* and *c* can coincide.

**Output**

Print a single number — the maximum possible number of ribbon pieces. It is guaranteed that at least one correct ribbon cutting exists.

Examples

input

```
5 5 3 2
```

output

```
2
```

input

```
7 5 5 2
```

output

```
2
```

Note

In the first example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 2, the second piece has length 3.

In the second example Polycarpus can cut the ribbon in such way: the first piece has length 5, the second piece has length 2.



思路：就是一个需要刚好装满的完全背包问题，只有三种商品a, b, c，能取无限件物品，每件物品价值是1，求最大价值。

```python
inf = 1e9 + 7
n,a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
dp = [0]+[-inf]*n

for i in range(1,n+1):
    for j in (a,b,c):
        if i >= j:
            #dp[i] = max(dp[i-j], dp[i-j] + 1, dp[i])
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-j] + 1, dp[i])

print(dp[n])
```



2020fall-cs101，王君宇。这道题状态转移方程就是 d[i]=max(d[i-a],d[i-b],d[i-c])+1，其中初始量是 0.到达一个新节点的方法有三种：+a、+b、+c，选取最大增量即可，思路十分精巧。

2020fall-cs101，黄旭。找到递推公式 dp[i] = max(dp[i-a], dp[i-b], dp[i-c]) + 1就好了。

```python
n,a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
dp = [0]+[-4000]*4000
for i in range(1,n+1):
    dp[i] = max(dp[i-a], dp[i-b], dp[i-c]) + 1
print(dp[n])
```



2020fall-cs101，赵春源。这是一个简单的DP思想，我们让f~i~等于把i按题意切开所得的最大段数，我们让$f_{0}=0$，其他的位置为负无穷，表示这个长度没法按题目的要求切开，我们考虑如何用较小的f推出较大的f，当然是把a,b,c三种切法都试一遍，最大长度就是$max(f[i-a], f[i-b], f[i-c])+1$

```python
n, a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
f = (n+1) * [-10000]
f[0] = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    if i >= a:
        f[i] = max(f[i], f[i - a] + 1)
    if i >= b:
        f[i] = max(f[i], f[i - b] + 1)
    if i >= c:
        f[i] = max(f[i], f[i - c] + 1)
print(f[n])
```



2020fall-cs101，成泽恺。一开始直接想暴力循环，三个片段a，b，c，一开始假设他可以分成i个a和j个b，i，j初始值都为0，while a~i~和a~i~+b~j~比n小的时候循环判断能不能加c片段进去，如果可以用max函数拿到此刻的片段数目的最大值，直到最后输出num即可，但这样用python3会超时，pypy3可以过。

```python
n,a,b,c = map(int, input().split())
num = 0
i = 0
j = 0
while a*i <= n:
    j = 0
    while b*j+a*i <= n:
        d = n - a*i - b*j
        if d%c==0 and a*i+b*j<=n:
            num = max(num, i+j+d//c)
        j += 1

    i += 1
 
print(num)
```



题目需要用到动态规划，这个问题相当于一个完全背包，背包容量是n，有重量为a，b，c的物品，物品价值都是1，求取在恰好装满背包的情况下价值最大。因为题目保证有解，开一个长度为n+1的列表，初始值为-9999（避免背包不被恰好装满的情况出现），容量为0的时候价值为0，容量为i的时候判断能不能放下重量为a，b，c的片段，如果能查看背包剩余容量i-a可以放多少，如果i-a不能被恰好填满，由于初始值是很大的负值，在装进去之后仍然是负值，不会影响最终结果。循环n次，最后得到最优解。



2020fall-cs101，刘安澜。思路：看上去这个题和老师上课讲的dp是一个镜像关系的题目，所以就按照找硬币的dp思路写了最初始的一版。但是不同于找硬币必有一个解，剪丝带对于某些丝带长度是无法分割的，所以这也就造成了在某些不能分割的长度上输出错误的结果。所以对于这种情况需要我们将除0外所有的初始值都赋为一个很大的负数，这样就能很好避免不能分割的长度对于其它可分割长度答案的扰动。

```python
def dpcut( lengthlist, l, maxcuts ):
    for i in range( l + 1 ):
        for j in [ c for c in lengthlist if c <= i ]:
            if maxcuts[i-j] + 1 > maxcuts[i]:
                maxcuts[i] = maxcuts[i-j] + 1
    return maxcuts[l]

l,a,b,c = map(int,input().split())
lengthlist = [a, b, c]
maxcuts = [0] + [-1000000]*l

print( dpcut( lengthlist, l, maxcuts ) )
```



## 580C. Kefa and Park



dfs and similar/graphs/trees, 1500, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/580/C

Kefa decided to celebrate his first big salary by going to the restaurant.

He lives by an unusual park. The park is a rooted tree consisting of *n* vertices with the root at vertex 1. Vertex 1 also contains Kefa's house. Unfortunaely for our hero, the park also contains cats. Kefa has already found out what are the vertices with cats in them.

The leaf vertices of the park contain restaurants. Kefa wants to choose a restaurant where he will go, but unfortunately he is very afraid of cats, so there is no way he will go to the restaurant if the path from the restaurant to his house contains more than *m* **consecutive** vertices with cats.

Your task is to help Kefa count the number of restaurants where he can go.

**Input**

The first line contains two integers, *n* and *m* (2 ≤ *n* ≤ 10^5^, 1 ≤ *m* ≤ *n*) — the number of vertices of the tree and the maximum number of consecutive vertices with cats that is still ok for Kefa.

The second line contains *n* integers *a*~1~, *a*~2~, ..., *a~n~*, where each *a~i~* either equals to 0 (then vertex *i* has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex *i* has a cat).

Next *n* - 1 lines contains the edges of the tree in the format "*x~i~* *y~i~*" (without the quotes) (1 ≤ *x~i~*, *y~i~* ≤ *n*, *x~i~* ≠ *y~i~*), where *x~i~* and *y~i~* are the vertices of the tree, connected by an edge.

It is guaranteed that the given set of edges specifies a tree.

**Output**

A single integer — the number of distinct leaves of a tree the path to which from Kefa's home contains at most *m* consecutive vertices with cats.

Examples

input

```
4 1
1 1 0 0
1 2
1 3
1 4
```

output

```
2
```

input

```
7 1
1 0 1 1 0 0 0
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
```

output

```
2
```

Note

Let us remind you that a *tree* is a connected graph on *n* vertices and *n* - 1 edge. A *rooted* tree is a tree with a special vertex called *root*. In a rooted tree among any two vertices connected by an edge, one vertex is a parent (the one closer to the root), and the other one is a child. A vertex is called a *leaf*, if it has no children.



Note to the first sample test:

![img](https://espresso.codeforces.com/785114b4b3f5336f02078c25750f87c5a1d0b4be.png)

The vertices containing cats are marked red. The restaurants are at vertices 2, 3, 4. Kefa can't go only to the restaurant located at vertex 2.

Note to the second sample test:

![img](https://espresso.codeforces.com/e5c07640680c837aec99126d94287872e69aa09a.png)

The restaurants are located at vertices 4, 5, 6, 7. Kefa can't go to restaurants 6, 7.



常规做法应该是图的遍历。可以参考bfs：https://www.codespeedy.com/breadth-first-search-algorithm-in-python/

```python
n,m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
cat = [0]+[int(i) for i in input().split()]
d = {}
t = 1
for i in range(n-1):
    x,y = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    # d.setdefault(x,[]).append(y)
    try:
        d[x].append(y)

## 466C. Number of Ways

binary search/brute force/data structures/dp/two pointers, 1700, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/466/C

You've got array *a*[1], *a*[2], ..., *a*[*n*], consisting of *n* integers. Count the number of ways to split all the elements of the array into three contiguous parts so that the sum of elements in each part is the same.

More formally, you need to find the number of such pairs of indices *i*, *j* (2 ≤ *i* ≤ *j* ≤ *n* - 1), that  $\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} a_k$= $\sum_{k=i}^{j} a_k$ =$\sum_{k=j+1}^{n} a_k$

**Input**

The first line contains integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 5·10^5^), showing how many numbers are in the array. The second line contains *n* integers *a*[1], *a*[2], ..., *a*[*n*] (|*a*[*i*]| ≤  10^9^) — the elements of array *a*.

**Output**

Print a single integer — the number of ways to split the array into three parts with the same sum.

2020fall-cs1010-汤建浩，思路：难点在于总和能除以三的部分。由于是分成连续的三部分，每部分一样，只需要对列表一项项地加下去。其中一些节点非常重要，如前缀和达到1/3 和达到2/3，此两项都要满足，且存在前缀和达到1/3先于前缀和达到2/3的情况，才能分成连续三份。出现一次前缀和达到1/3 不能说明什么，但我们要记录下来s++，在它之后出现前缀和2/3，我们就把这个情况ans += s



2020fall-cs101-王君宇，思路：这道题的最大坑点就是分割是有序的...我因为没认真审题而半天毫无头绪。既然是有序的，我们可以遍历逐个求和。如果总和不是 3的倍数显然不能分割，否则我们先得到sum/3，之后是 2*sum/3. 因此我们可以分成两步。当我们得到第一个分割之后，每得到一种便相应将二级种数加一。得到第二个分割后就将之前分割的总种数加起来。这里运用了类似于乘法原理的分布计数思想。另外，我们求和的终点应当是倒数第二个元素，防止 sum==0时总种数出错。



2020fall-cs101-黄旭，思路：将列表中的元素进行累加，由于要将其三等分，所以计算总和的三分之一以及三分之二，并应该将能得到三分之一的方法数乘以能得到三分之二的方法数从而得到方法总数，方法能想到就不难，不然可能要想很久很久（比如昨晚做到很晚）

双指针，同向右走，前缀和2/3的指针一定在前缀和1/3的右侧，所以正确。

例如：

5

3		3		-3		3		3

双指针向右走的过程

​	ans=1			ans+=s

​		=>					=>

3		3		-3		3		3

->		->		->

s=1				s=2



```python
n = int(input())
a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
s = sum(a)
x = 0
if s%3 == 0:
    d1 = s/3
    d2 = 2*d1
    z = t = 0
    for i in range(n-1):
        z += a[i]

        if z == d2:
            x += t
        if z == d1:
            t += 1
print(x)
```





解题思路：前缀和优化。当前缀和达到1/3时s++，达到2/3时候 ans += s

```python
n = int(input())
a = [0]
a.extend([int(x) for x in input().split()])

prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(1, n+1):
    prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + a[i]
    
if (prefix_sum[n]%3) != 0:
    print(0)
else:
    s = ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):         
        if i>1 and i<n and prefix_sum[i]==(prefix_sum[n]*2//3):
            ans += s
        
        if prefix_sum[i] == (prefix_sum[n]//3):
            s += 1
            
    print(ans)
```



解题思路：tutorial, https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/13758 

First of all, notice that if sum of all elements is equal *S* then sum of each of three parts is equal$S/3$
Therefore, if *S* is not divided by 3 — then answer is 0.
Otherwise, let’s iterate the end of first part *i* (1 ≤ *i* ≤ *n* - 2) and if sum of 1..i elements is equal $S/3$  then it means that we have to add to the answer the amount of such *j* (*i* + 1 < *j*) that the sum of elements from *j*-th to *n*-tn also equals $S/3$.

Let’s create an array $cnt[]$, where  $cnt[i]$ equals 1, if the sum of elements from *i*-th to *n*-th equals $S/3$ and 0 — otherwise. Now, to calculate the answer we have to find the sum `cnt[j] + cnt[j+1] + ... + cnt[n]` faster then O(n). There are a lot of required ways to do this, but the easiest one is to create a new additional array `sums[]` where in *j*-th element will be `cnt[j] + cnt[j+1] + ... + cnt[n]`. It is easy to calculate in such way: `sums[n] = cnt[n]`, `sums[i] = sums[i+1] + cnt[i] (i < n)`.

Thus, we receive very simple solution: for each prefix of initial array 1..i with the sum that equals $S/3$ we need to add to the answer `sums[i+2]`.

**Complexity**: *O*(*n*)

```python
n = int(input())
a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
s = sum(a)

if s%3 != 0:
    print(0)
else:
    s = s//3
    
    ss = 0
    cnt = [0]*1000010

    for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):
        ss += a[i]
        if ss == s:
            cnt[i] = 1

    for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
        cnt[i] += cnt[i+1]

    ans = 0
    ss = 0
    for i in range(n-2):
        ss += a[i]
        if ss == s:
            ans += cnt[i+2]

    print(ans)
```

## 455A. Boredom

dp, 1500, https://codeforces.com/contest/455/problem/A

Alex doesn't like boredom. That's why whenever he gets bored, he comes up with games. One long winter evening he came up with a game and decided to play it.

Given a sequence *a* consisting of *n* integers. The player can make several steps. In a single step he can choose an element of the sequence (let's denote it *a~k~*) and delete it, at that all elements equal to *a~k~* + 1 and *a~k~* - 1 also must be deleted from the sequence. That step brings *a~k~* points to the player.

Alex is a perfectionist, so he decided to get as many points as possible. Help him.

**Input**

The first line contains integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 105) that shows how many numbers are in Alex's sequence.

The second line contains *n* integers *a*~1~, *a*~2~, ..., *a~n~* (1 ≤ *a~i~* ≤ 10^5^).

**Output**

Print a single integer — the maximum number of points that Alex can earn.

Examples

input

```
2
1 2
```

output

```
2
```

input

```
3
1 2 3
```

output

```
4
```

input

```
9
1 2 1 3 2 2 2 2 3
```

output

```
10
```

Note

Consider the third test example. At first step we need to choose any element equal to 2. After that step our sequence looks like this [2, 2, 2, 2]. Then we do 4 steps, on each step we choose any element equals to 2. In total we earn 10 points.

## 545C. Woodcutters

dp/greedy, 1500, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/545/C

Little Susie listens to fairy tales before bed every day. Today's fairy tale was about wood cutters and the little girl immediately started imagining the choppers cutting wood. She imagined the situation that is described below.

There are *n* trees located along the road at points with coordinates *x*~1~, *x*~2~, ..., *x~n~*. Each tree has its height *h~i~*. Woodcutters can cut down a tree and fell it to the left or to the right. After that it occupies one of the segments [*x~i~* - *h~i~*, *x~i~*] or [*x~i~*;*x~i~* + *h~i~*]. The tree that is not cut down occupies a single point with coordinate *x~i~*. Woodcutters can fell a tree if the segment to be occupied by the fallen tree doesn't contain any occupied point. The woodcutters want to process as many trees as possible, so Susie wonders, what is the maximum number of trees to fell.

**Input**

The first line contains integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 10^5^) — the number of trees.

Next *n* lines contain pairs of integers *x~i~*, *h~i~* (1 ≤ *x~i~*, *h~i~* ≤ 10^9^) — the coordinate and the height of the *і*-th tree.

The pairs are given in the order of ascending *x~i~*. No two trees are located at the point with the same coordinate.

**Output**

Print a single number — the maximum number of trees that you can cut down by the given rules.

Examples

input

```
5
1 2
2 1
5 10
10 9
19 1
```

output

```
3
```

input

```
5
1 2
2 1
5 10
10 9
20 1
```

output

```
4
```

Note

In the first sample you can fell the trees like that:

- fell the 1-st tree to the left — now it occupies segment [ - 1;1]
- fell the 2-nd tree to the right — now it occupies segment [2;3]
- leave the 3-rd tree — it occupies point 5
- leave the 4-th tree — it occupies point 10
- fell the 5-th tree to the right — now it occupies segment [19;20]

In the second sample you can also fell 4-th tree to the right, after that it will occupy segment [10;19].

因为要让更多的树被砍到，而一棵树是否被砍倒只与临近的两颗树相关，所以能倒就倒，不能往左就往右，所以直接暴力判断了。（向右倒会占用下一棵树左边的空间，所以要比向左边倒的情况多考虑一点！）

```python

## 1000B. Light It Up

greedy, 1500, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1000/B

Recently, you bought a brand new smart lamp with programming features. At first, you set up a schedule to the lamp. Every day it will turn power on at moment 0 and turn power off at moment M. Moreover, the lamp allows you to set a program of switching its state (states are "lights on" and "lights off"). Unfortunately, some program is already installed into the lamp.

The lamp allows only *good* programs. Good program can be represented as a non-empty array a, where 0<a~1~<a~2~<⋯<a~|a|~<M. All a~i~ must be integers. Of course, preinstalled program is a good program.

The lamp follows program a in next manner: at moment 0 turns power and light on. Then at moment a~i~ the lamp flips its state to opposite (if it was lit, it turns off, and vice versa). The state of the lamp flips instantly: for example, if you turn the light off at moment 1 and then do nothing, the total time when the lamp is lit will be 1. Finally, at moment M the lamp is turning its power off regardless of its state.

Since you are not among those people who read instructions, and you don't understand the language it's written in, you realize (after some testing) the only possible way to alter the preinstalled program. You can **insert at most one** element into the program a, so it still should be a *good* program after alteration. Insertion can be done between any pair of consecutive elements of a, or even at the beginning or at the end of a.

Find such a way to alter the program that the total time when the lamp is lit is maximum possible. Maybe you should leave program untouched. If the lamp is lit from x till moment y, then its lit for y−x units of time. Segments of time when the lamp is lit are summed up.

**Input**

First line contains two space separated integers n and M (1≤n≤10^5^, 2≤M≤10^9^) — the length of program a and the moment when power turns off.

Second line contains n space separated integers a~1~,a~2~,…,a~n~(0<a~1~<a~2~<⋯<a~n~<M) — initially installed program a.

**Output**

Print the only integer — maximum possible total time when the lamp is lit.

Examples

input

```
3 10
4 6 7
```

output

```
8
```

input

```
2 12
1 10
```

output

```
9
```

input

```
2 7
3 4
```

output

```
6
```

Note

In the first example, one of possible optimal solutions is to insert value x=3x=3 before a1a1, so program will be [3,4,6,7][3,4,6,7] and time of lamp being lit equals (3−0)+(6−4)+(10−7)=8(3−0)+(6−4)+(10−7)=8. Other possible solution is to insert x=5x=5 in appropriate place.

In the second example, there is only one optimal solution: to insert x=2x=2 between a1a1 and a2a2. Program will become [1,2,10][1,2,10], and answer will be (1−0)+(10−2)=9(1−0)+(10−2)=9.

In the third example, optimal answer is to leave program untouched, so answer will be (3−0)+(7−4)=6(3−0)+(7−4)=6.

若额外添加开关：由题意，开灯的时间越长越好，所以就算额外添加开关，也必须在一次关灯a~i~的前或后1个时间单位添加。

计算ans：**添加处及之前的奇数项，加上添加处之后的（本来的）偶数项，再减去添加处与本来开灯的时间点相差的1个时间单位**。



先计算出不插入新操作的答案，再考虑怎么插有可能更新答案。

在位置$x$处插入的本质是使$x$后开着的时间变成关着的，关着的时间变成开着的。

经过画图思考知道在一次关灯的前后1个时间单位添加，是等效的，所以只考虑关灯后的下一个时刻（即关灯后的下一时刻是最优的，不会劣于其他情况）。我们枚举位置，计算答案取max即可。

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()] + [m]
tot = ans = s = 0
for i in range(1, len(a), 2):
    tot += a[i] - a[i-1]
ans = tot						  	#总开灯时间

    s += a[i-1] - a[i-2]			#前 i 次开灯时间
    if a[i] > a[i-1] + 1:			#若关灯时长大于 1
        t = tot -s					#导出后 n-i 次开灯时间
        ans = max(ans, s + m-a[i-1]-t - 1)	#之前奇数项+之后偶数项-1

## 134B. Multiply by 2, divide by 6

math, 900, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1374/B

You are given an integer *n*. In one move, you can either multiply *n* by two or divide *n* by *6* (if it is divisible by *6* without the remainder).

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to obtain *1* from *n* or determine if it's impossible to do that.

You have to answer *t* independent test cases.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains one integer *t*(1≤t≤2⋅10^4^) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer *n* (1≤n≤10^9^).

**Output**

For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of moves needed to obtain 1 from *n* if it's possible to do that or -1 if it's impossible to obtain 1 from *n*.

Example

input

```
7
1
2
3
12
12345
15116544
387420489
```

output

```
0
-1
2
-1
-1
12
36
```

Note

Consider the sixth test case of the example. The answer can be obtained by the following sequence of moves from the given integer 1511654415116544:

1. Divide by 66 and get 25194242519424;

2020fall-cs101-顾臻宜的解题思路：只要𝑛=2^x^3^y^且𝑦≥𝑥,𝑥,𝑦∈𝑁即可，且最多进行2𝑙𝑜𝑔~3~𝑛步。

小知识：import math之后math.log（真数N，底数a）就是𝑙𝑜𝑔~a~𝑁。

```python
import math

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = 0
    for i in range(2*(1+int(math.log(n,3)))):
        if n/6 == int(n/6):
            n /= 6
            x += 1
        else:
            if n/3 == int(n/3):
                n *= 2
                x += 1
    
print(x if n==1 else -1)
```

2020fall-cs101-黄旭思路：如果一个数在经过题目所说操作之后可以得到 1，那么一定在每一个步骤中都是 3的倍数，于是在循环中一旦发现该数不是 3的倍数，就跳出循环，反之就一直进行*2或者/6的操作，直到等于一为止，记录操作次数，若结果为 1则输出操作次数，反之输出-1。

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    a = 0
    while x!=1:
        if x%3:
            break
        elif x%6==0:
            x=x/6
            a+=1
        else:
            x*=2
            a+=1
    print([a,-1][x!=1])

## 230B. T-primes

binary search/implementation/math/number theory, 1300, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/230/B

We know that prime numbers are positive integers that have exactly two distinct positive divisors. Similarly, we'll call a positive integer *t* Т-prime, if *t* has exactly three distinct positive divisors.

You are given an array of *n* positive integers. For each of them determine whether it is Т-prime or not.

**Input**

The first line contains a single positive integer, *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 10^5^), showing how many numbers are in the array. The next line contains *n* space-separated integers *x~i~* (1 ≤ *x~i~* ≤ 10^12^).

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is advised to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

**Output**

Print *n* lines: the *i*-th line should contain "YES" (without the quotes), if number *x~i~* is Т-prime, and "NO" (without the quotes), if it isn't.

Examples

input

```
3
4 5 6
```

output

```
YES
NO
NO
```

Note

The given test has three numbers. The first number 4 has exactly three divisors — 1, 2 and 4, thus the answer for this number is "YES". The second number 5 has two divisors (1 and 5), and the third number 6 has four divisors (1, 2, 3, 6), hence the answer for them is "NO".

## 270A. Fancy Fence

geometry/implementation/math, 1100, x23265, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/270/A

Emuskald needs a fence around his farm, but he is too lazy to build it himself. So he purchased a fence-building robot.

He wants the fence to be a regular polygon. The robot builds the fence along a single path, but it can only make fence corners at a single angle *a*.

Will the robot be able to build the fence Emuskald wants? In other words, is there a regular polygon which angles are equal to *a*?

**Input**

The first line of input contains an integer *t* (0 < *t* < 180) — the number of tests. Each of the following *t* lines contains a single integer *a* (0 < *a* < 180) — the angle the robot can make corners at measured in degrees.

**Output**

For each test, output on a single line "YES" (without quotes), if the robot can build a fence Emuskald wants, and "NO" (without quotes), if it is impossible.

Examples

input

```
3
30
60
90
```

output

```
NO
YES
YES
```

Note

In the first test case, it is impossible to build the fence, since there is no regular polygon with angle ![img](https://espresso.codeforces.com/df5f4b07dd5316fde165b43657b2696e2919e791.png).

In the second test case, the fence is a regular triangle, and in the last test case — a square.



2020fall-cs101-黄旭：对于 n边形，其内角和为（n-2）*180°，内角为x度，有(n-2)\*180=n\*x。 则可以得到 n的表达式为 n=360/（180-x），若 n为整数，则可行，反之不可行。

```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    x=int(input())
    print(['NO','YES'][360%(180-x)==0])    
```

```python
n=int(input())
def check(x):
    if 360%(180-x)==0:
        return"YES"
    else:
        return"NO"

## 1221A. 2048 Game

brute force/greedy/math, 1000, x11647, http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1221/A

You are playing a variation of game 2048. Initially you have a multiset s of n integers. Every integer in this multiset is a power of two.

You may perform any number (possibly, zero) operations with this multiset.

During each operation you choose two **equal** integers from s, remove them from s and insert the number equal to their sum into s.

For example, if *s*={1,2,1,1,4,2,2}and you choose integers 2 and 2, then the multiset becomes {1,1,1,4,4,2}.

You win if the number 2048 belongs to your multiset. For example, if s={1024,512,512,4}you can win as follows: choose 512 and 512, your multiset turns into {1024,1024,4}. Then choose 1024 and 1024, your multiset turns into {2048,4} and you win.

You have to determine if you can win this game.

You have to answer *q* independent queries.

**Input**

The first line contains one integer q (1≤q≤100) – the number of queries.

The first line of each query contains one integer n (1≤n≤100) — the number of elements in multiset.

The second line of each query contains n integers s~1~,s~2~,…,s~n~ (1≤s~i~≤2^29^) — the description of the multiset. It is guaranteed that all elements of the multiset are powers of two.

**Output**

For each query print YES if it is possible to obtain the number 2048 in your multiset, and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

input

```
6
4
1024 512 64 512
1
2048
3
64 512 2
2
4096 4
7
2048 2 2048 2048 2048 2048 2048
2
2048 4096
```

output

```
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
YES
```

Note

In the first query you can win as follows: choose 512 and 512, and ss turns into {1024,64,1024}. Then choose 1024 and 1024, and ss turns into {2048,64} and you win.

In the second query s contains 2048 initially.

            s.remove(l[i])            
            s.remove(l[i])            
            s.append(2*l[i])    
    
    if 2048 in s:        
       	print('YES')    
    else:        
       	print('NO')
```



```Python
for t in range(int(input())):
	n = input()
	l = filter(lambda x : x <= 2048,  map(int, input().split()) )
	print('YES' if sum(l) >= 2048 else 'NO')
```



2020fall-cs101-邹京驰，版本 1：学习了列表型对象的 count方法。按照 2048原本玩法的逻辑顺序，对于先天没有 2048的情况，先把全部 1全部合成为 2（可能剩下单个 1无法合成，则略），再把 2（包括上一步用 1合成的）全部合成为 4，以此类推，直到把 1024全部合成为 2048，若合成出的 2048的数量大于 1则 YES，否则NO.

```python
q = int(input())
for i in range(0, q):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if 2048 in s:
        print('YES')
    else:
        t = 0
        for j in range(0, 11):
            t1 = s.count(2**j) + t
            t = t1//2
        if t > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```



2020fall-cs101-邹京驰，版本 2：注意到数学：只需把小于等于 2048的元素加和大于等于 2048即满足条件。原因：在 2048一下因为落单而被舍弃的元素达到最多时加和为1+2+4+8+......+512+1024=2047 ，这一加和本来就不到 2048，且新增1~1024的任何一个元素就可以生成 2048.因此生成新的 2048当且仅当1~1024的元素直接加和达到 2048。再并入先天有 2048的情况，只需把小于等于 2048的元素加和大于等于 2048即满足条件。

```python
q = int(input())
for i in range(0, q):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    su = 0
    for j in range(0, n):
        if s[j] <= 2048:
            su = su + s[j]

    if su >= 2048:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```



## 1427B. Chess Cheater

greedy/implementation/sortings, 1400, x5683, https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1427/B

You like playing chess tournaments online.

In your last tournament you played n games. For the sake of this problem, each chess game is either won or lost (no draws). When you lose a game you get 0 points. When you win you get 1 or 2 points: if you have won also the previous game you get 2 points, otherwise you get 1 point. If you win the very first game of the tournament you get 1 point (since there is not a "previous game").

The outcomes of the n games are represented by a string s of length n: the i-th character of s is W if you have won the i-th game, while it is L if you have lost the i-th game.

After the tournament, you notice a bug on the website that allows you to change the outcome of **at most** k of your games (meaning that at most k times you can change some symbol L to W, or W to L). Since your only goal is to improve your chess rating, you decide to cheat and use the bug.

Compute the maximum score you can get by cheating in the optimal way.

**Input**

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤20,000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each testcase contains two integers n,k (1≤n≤100,000, 0≤k≤n) – the number of games played and the number of outcomes that you can change.

The second line contains a string s of length n containing only the characters W and L. If you have won the i-th game then s~i~=W, if you have lost the ii-th game then s~i~=L.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 200,000.

**Output**

For each testcase, print a single integer – the maximum score you can get by cheating in the optimal way.

Example

input

```
8
5 2
WLWLL
6 5
LLLWWL
7 1
LWLWLWL
15 5
WWWLLLWWWLLLWWW
40 7
LLWLWLWWWLWLLWLWWWLWLLWLLWLLLLWLLWWWLWWL
1 0
L
1 1
L
6 1
WLLWLW
```

output

```
7
11
6
26
46
0
1
6
```

Note

**Explanation of the first testcase.** Before changing any outcome, the score is 2. Indeed, you won the first game, so you got 1 point, and you won also the third, so you got another 1 point (and not 2 because you lost the second game).

An optimal way to cheat is to change the outcomes of the second and fourth game. Doing so, you end up winning the first four games (the string of the outcomes becomes WWWWL). Hence, the new score is 7=1+2+2+2: 1 point for the first game and 2 points for the second, third and fourth game.

**Explanation of the second testcase.** Before changing any outcome, the score is 3. Indeed, you won the fourth game, so you got 1 point, and you won also the fifth game, so you got 2 more points (since you won also the previous game).

An optimal way to cheat is to change the outcomes of the first, second, third and sixth game. Doing so, you end up winning all games (the string of the outcomes becomes WWWWWW). Hence, the new score is 11=1+2+2+2+2+2: 1 point for the first game and 2 points for all the other games.



**思路：**https://www.bbsmax.com/A/WpdKEVpmJV/

请注意，分数等于 \[score =2⋅＃\{wins\} −＃\{winning\_streaks\}\]，连胜是连续获胜的最大顺序。

在下面的说明中，变量\(＃\{wins\}，＃\{winning\_streaks\}\) 始终与初始情况相关。

如果 \(k +＃\{wins\}≥n\)，则有可能赢得所有比赛，因此答案为 \(2n-1\) 。

否则，很明显，我们要转换k获胜中的k损失。因此，作弊后，获胜次数将为\(k +＃\{wins\}\)。考虑到以上公式，仍然仅是要减少获胜间隔的数量。

我们如何才能减少获胜间隔的数量？非常直观的是，我们将从长度最短的差距开始，以“填补”连续的获胜间隔之间的差距。可以证明，如果没有填补 g 个缺口（即在作弊之后，g个缺口仍然至少包含一个损失），则至少有g + 1个获胜间隔。  

实现过程如下。通过线性扫描，我们可以找到间隙的长度，然后对它们进行排序。最后，我们计算可以选择的总和 \(≤k\) 的数量。答案是

\[2⋅（k +＃\{wins\}）−＃\{winning\_streaks\} +＃\{gaps\_we\_can\_fill\}\]

解决方案的复杂度为 \(O(log(n))\)。
